          <p>Our objective is to produce academically competent persons with real-life experiences when our kids leave our school doors after completing their school career. They are future-ready with a skill set that will be required in their Next Gen careers as a result of their investigations, analyses, and applications.</p>

          <p>We intend to cultivate these quotients in school through various projects and mentor sessions, so their EQ, SQ, and HQ will be high. Our kids will be better prepared for their future academic endeavours and occupations.</p>
